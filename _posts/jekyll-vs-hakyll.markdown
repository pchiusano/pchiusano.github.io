This blog runs off GitHub pages and Jekyll. It's convenient being able to produce posts directly in markdown and preview them in the browser, which I'm hoping will encourage me to post more frequently, I have some problems with the design of Jekyll. It suffers from the 'curse of magic implicit configuration'.
