title: Unison now open source and has its own site

I finally wrapped up most of the housecleaning I wanted to do before releasing the code. It's [now public on GitHub](https://github.com/unisonweb/platform) and there's also a dedicated [project site and blog at unisonweb.org](http://unisonweb.org/) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/unisonweb). Going forward, I'll be posting about Unison from [unisonweb.org](http://unisonweb.org/), and any contributors to the project will also be able to use that space for Unison-related posts.

There's currently a post up with a [status update and tentative roadmap](http://unisonweb.org/2015-05-07/update.html#post-start).

I'm definitely interested in [finding funding to continue work on Unison](http://unisonweb.org/2015-05-07/update.html#funding), but am not really sure what is realistic or possible. I'd love to hear in [the comments](http://unisonweb.org/2015-05-07/update.html#disqus_thread) from folks who might have ideas or thoughts about this sort of thing.
