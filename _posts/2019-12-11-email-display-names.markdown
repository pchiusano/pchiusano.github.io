title: Email display names do not need to be LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME now that computers are a thing
---

I received an email recently from a guy, let's call him Robert Smith (name changed to protect the innocent), whose email display name was `"Smith, Robert" <robert.smith@somedomain.com>`. 

As far as I can tell, the `LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME` convention is a holdover from the pre-computer days where you needed to have the last name at the start  for easy visual scanning when searching some directory (like a phone  book) by last name. Now that we have computers that can search any which way, there's no reason to put up with the (weird to read)  `LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME` convention. If you continue to use it, it signals you aren't really in the loop on all this new-fangled "computer stuff" and is nearly as bad as continued use of an aol or hotmail email address or using terms like "cyberspace"  or "information superhighway" non-ironically. ðŸ˜€

I'm half joking and this might seem like a silly thing, but it's a little example of this other general phenomenon: whenever new technology is introduced, people sometimes carry forward old ways of working that no longer make sense. We forget to ask ourselves *why* things were done a certain way and if we should maybe do things differently now.

Question everything!
