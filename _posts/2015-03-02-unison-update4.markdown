title: Unison update 4&#58; more editor interactions
---

I'm going to update this post when I have a video to show, but I've hooked up a number of additional editor interactions, including evaluation of any term as well as beta and eta reduction. I've also hooked up the global term search, so the explorer shows type compatible terms in local as well as global scope. The explorer now shows terms which are ill-typed but which match the search query. I also made a number of tweaks to the editor interactions to feel more fluid. 

I'm going to build out the library of builtins a bit so that I can, for instance, add some numbers together! Stay tuned.
