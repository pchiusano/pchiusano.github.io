If your company is interested in getting help leveraging Scala, Haskell, Elm or functional programming in general, please [contact me](mailto:paul.chiusano@stage-n.com) about working together. Here's a broad summary of services I offer:

* Mentorship, code and design reviews, pair programming, and coaching, especially for growing Scala teams looking to make sure code quality stays high.
* Support for [FS2: Functional Streams for Scala](http://fs2.co)
* Functional design and implementation, at all levels, including system architecture, libraries and DSLs. I've been doing these things professionally for many years.
* Training and/or tech talks, tailored to the interests and experience of your team.
